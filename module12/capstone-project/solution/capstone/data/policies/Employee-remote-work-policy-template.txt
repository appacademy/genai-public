Employee remote work policy template
This Employee remote work policy template is ready to be tailored to your company’s needs and should be considered a starting point for setting up your employment policies.
Policy brief & purpose
Our Employee remote work policy outlines our guidelines for employees who work from a location other than our offices. We want to ensure that both employees and our company will benefit from these arrangements.
Scope
This policy applies to employees whose primary work location is not at our offices.
Policy elements
Remote working is a permanent or temporary agreement between employees and managers to work from a non-office location for more than [three days.]
Working from home for a maximum of [two days] or working from home certain days a week on a recurring basis are situations covered by our work from home policy.
Remote working agreement
Employees may work remotely on a permanent or temporary basis.
Permanent remote work employees should indicate their primary working address in a remote working agreement. This contract will also outline their responsibilities as remote employees.
Office-based employees may also work remotely for a maximum of [two consecutive weeks] per year if [they want to visit family/ their birthplace.] Eligible employees are those who have been employed by our company for at least [a year.] Employees who are new parents or suffer from short-term/long-term disability may agree to longer periods of remote working with their manager and HR.
Office-based employees may also revert to permanent remote working in cases of relocation. HR will assess their eligibility on a case-by-case basis.
Employees who want to work remotely must submit a request by [asking HR for a form/ through our HRIS.]
Remote working that works
To ensure that employee performance will not suffer in remote work arrangements, we advise our remote employees to:
Choose a quiet and distraction-free working space.
Have an internet connection that’s adequate for their job.
Dedicate their full attention to their job duties during working hours.
Adhere to break and attendance schedules agreed upon with their manager.
Ensure their schedules overlap with those of their team members for as long as is necessary to complete their job duties effectively.
Team members and managers should determine long-term and short-term goals. They should frequently meet (either online or in-person when possible) to discuss progress and results.
Compliance with Policies
Our remote employees must follow our company’s policies like their office-based colleagues. Examples of policies that all employees should abide by are:
Attendance.
Social media.
Confidentiality.
Data protection.
Employee Code of Conduct.
Anti-discrimination/Equal opportunity.
Dress code when meeting with customers or partners.
Compensation and benefits
Compensation is determined by job role. Health insurance, PTO and other individual or group benefits are not altered by a remote working agreement.
Remote employees will also receive [$100] per month as a remote-working allowance to cover office-related costs (e.g. electricity and rent.) Occasionally, we may pay for our remote employees to visit our offices.
Equipment
We will provide our remote employees with equipment that is essential to their job duties, like laptops, headsets and cell phones (when applicable.) We will install VPN and company-required software when employees receive their equipment. We will not provide secondary equipment (e.g. printers and screens.)
Equipment that we provide is company property. Employees must keep it safe and avoid any misuse. Specifically, employees must:
Keep their equipment password protected.
Store equipment in a safe and clean space when not in use.
Follow all data encryption, protection standards and settings.
Refrain from downloading suspicious, unauthorized or illegal software.
HR will discuss insurance needs with employees. Employees may have to take up homeowner’s insurance to cover the cost of company equipment. HR may reimburse a portion of the coverage when applicable.

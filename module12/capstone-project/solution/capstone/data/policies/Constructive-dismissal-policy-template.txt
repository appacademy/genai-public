Policy brief & purpose
Constructive dismissal policy provides a framework for understanding and addressing situations where an employee resigns due to a significant change in their work environment or employment terms. This policy provides practical advice to avoid issues that might arise from situations that could lead to constructive dismissal.

Scope
This policy applies to all the employees.

Policy elements
Understanding constructive dismissal
Constructive dismissal occurs when an employee resigns because their employer's behavior has become so intolerable or made life so difficult that the employee has no choice but to resign. For instance, if we unilaterally change the terms of your employment contract (e.g., significantly reducing your salary, changing your working hours, or changing your job description without your agreement), this could potentially be seen as constructive dismissal.

Avoiding constructive dismissal
We are committed to maintaining a positive work environment and treating all employees fairly. Therefore, we will:

Ensure that changes to employment contracts are mutually agreed upon.
Maintain open lines of communication with all employees to address concerns promptly.
Provide support and resources to managers and supervisors to handle employee issues appropriately.
Regularly review and update our policies and procedures to ensure they are fair and transparent.

Reporting and addressing constructive dismissal claims
If you believe you are experiencing circumstances that could lead to constructive dismissal, we encourage you to:

Document all incidents that contribute to your work environment becoming intolerable.
Report these incidents to your supervisor or HR department as soon as possible.
Seek advice and support from the HR department.

We will investigate all reports thoroughly and take necessary actions to resolve the situation. 

This may include mediation, changes to work practices, or disciplinary action against those responsible.

Disciplinary consequences
If a manager or supervisor is found to have created an environment that leads to constructive dismissal, they will face disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Examples of such behavior include, but are not limited to:

Unilaterally changing the terms of an employee's contract without their agreement.
Creating a hostile work environment.
Failing to address reported issues that contribute to an intolerable work environment.

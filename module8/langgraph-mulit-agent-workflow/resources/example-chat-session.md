Subject: Regarding Your Subscription Cancellation - John D.

Dear John D.,

Thank you for contacting SaaS Solutions Inc. and for requesting to cancel your subscription. I understand you’d like to cancel, and I’m happy to assist you with that process.

Before we proceed, could you please confirm which subscription tier you are currently on? This will help me ensure a smooth cancellation.

Just to reiterate our policy regarding cancellations, your service will continue until the end of your current billing period. Please note that we do not issue refunds for partial months. However, we do offer prorated refunds for subscription cancellations based on the unused portion of your billing cycle, which typically takes 5-7 business days to appear on your statement. 

To help me process this efficiently, could you also please confirm the date you signed up for your subscription? 

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

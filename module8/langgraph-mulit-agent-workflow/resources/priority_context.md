## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

Below are answers to common questions about urgent support and emergency procedures:

### What qualifies as an urgent or priority issue?
Priority issues typically include:
1. Complete system outages affecting multiple users.
2. Data security incidents or potential breaches.
3. Critical feature failures impacting core business operations.
4. Account compromise or unauthorized access.
5. Payment processing failures affecting multiple transactions.
6. Compliance-related emergencies with legal implications.
Individual feature requests, non-critical bugs, or preference-based issues generally don't qualify as urgent.

### How do I report an urgent issue?
Enterprise customers can report urgent issues 24/7 through our emergency hotline at 1-800-555-9999, through the 'Report Critical Issue' button in your account dashboard, or by emailing [urgent@ourcompany.com](mailto:urgent@ourcompany.com). Pro customers can use the emergency chat option available in the product. Please include as much detail as possible about the issue, including error messages, affected functionality, and business impact.

### What response time can I expect for urgent issues?
For confirmed Priority 1 (urgent) issues, Enterprise customers can expect an initial response within 15 minutes, with regular updates every 30 minutes until resolution. Pro customers can expect an initial response within 30 minutes during business hours and within 2 hours outside business hours. Resolution times vary based on complexity, but we work continuously on urgent issues until they're resolved.

### Who handles urgent support requests?
Urgent support requests are handled by our senior support engineers and escalated immediately to the appropriate specialized team. For system-wide issues, our on-call engineering team is engaged. For security incidents, our security response team takes the lead. Each urgent issue is assigned a dedicated incident manager who coordinates the response and provides regular updates.

### Is there an additional cost for priority support?
There is no additional cost for legitimate urgent issue handling. Priority support for true emergencies is included in Pro and Enterprise subscriptions. However, we do distinguish between actual emergencies and preference for faster service. Repeatedly marking non-urgent issues as urgent may result in coaching about appropriate priority levels.

### What information should I provide when reporting an urgent issue?
When reporting an urgent issue, please provide:
1. A clear description of the problem.
2. When it started occurring.
3. Error messages or screenshots.
4. Steps to reproduce the issue.
5. The business impact and urgency level.
6. The number of users affected.
7. Any troubleshooting steps already attempted.
8. The best contact information for updates.
The more information you provide, the faster we can address the issue.

### Do you provide post-incident reports?
Yes, for major system incidents and security-related issues, we provide detailed post-incident reports to Enterprise customers. These reports include a timeline of the incident, root cause analysis, resolution details, and preventative measures implemented to avoid similar issues in the future. Reports are typically delivered within 5 business days after incident resolution.

### How do I escalate an issue if I'm not satisfied with the response?
If you feel an issue isn't receiving appropriate attention, Enterprise customers can contact their dedicated account manager or use the executive escalation process by emailing [escalations@ourcompany.com](mailto:escalations@ourcompany.com). Pro customers can request escalation through support by asking for a 'supervisor review.' Please include your case number and the reason for escalation. All escalation requests are reviewed by a support manager within 1 hour during business hours.

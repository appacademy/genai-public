### Can I change subscription tiers at any time?

Downgrades are also possible but take effect at the end of your current billing cycle. To change your tier, go to *Account Settings > Billing > Subscription Plan*. Please note that downgrading may result in loss of access to certain features and data associated with higher-tier functionality.

### Do you offer a free trial?
Yes, we offer a 14-day free trial of our Pro tier with all features included. No credit card is required to start the trial. At the end of the trial period, you can select the tier that best meets your needs, or your account will automatically convert to our Basic tier. Any data you create during the trial period will be preserved when you subscribe.

### How often do you release new features?
We release new features and improvements on the first Tuesday of each month. Minor updates and bug fixes may be deployed more frequently. Enterprise customers receive access to our quarterly roadmap, and all customers receive release notes for major updates. You can subscribe to our product updates newsletter to stay informed about new features.

### How can I request a new feature?
You can submit feature requests through the 'Feedback' option in your account menu or by emailing [feedback@ourcompany.com](mailto:feedback@ourcompany.com). Include as much detail as possible about your use case and requirements. Feature requests are reviewed quarterly by our product team, and popular requests are prioritized for development. Enterprise customers have a dedicated channel for feature requests through their account manager.

### What integrations do you support?
We support integrations with major productivity and business tools. Basic tier includes Google Workspace and Microsoft 365. Pro tier adds Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack, Zoom, and Asana. Enterprise tier includes all available integrations plus custom integration options. All tiers can access Zapier integration for connecting to 3,000+ other applications. Detailed integration setup guides are available in our [knowledge base](http://support.ourcompany.com).

### Do you have a mobile app?
Yes, we offer mobile apps for iOS and Android that allow you to access key features on the go. Basic tier users can view and make simple updates. Pro and Enterprise users gain access to advanced mobile features, including approval workflows, document scanning, and offline access. Our mobile apps are regularly updated and maintain the same security standards as our web application.

### What happens to my data if I cancel my subscription?
If you cancel your subscription, you'll maintain access to your account until the end of your current billing period. After that, accounts enter a 30-day read-only period where you can view but not modify data. You can export your data during this time. After 30 days, your data is scheduled for deletion. If you reactivate within 90 days, we may be able to restore your account data upon request.

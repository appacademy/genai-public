### Task 3: Fallback Strategy Development (30 minutes)

1. Examine the fallback chain architecture in `core/strategy.py`:
   - Understand how the FallbackStrategy class organizes fallback options
   - Study the relationship between ComponentType enums and component instances

2. Complete the **FallbackStrategy initialization** in `core/strategy.py`:
   - Initialize the fallback_chains dictionary with ComponentType keys
   - Map each component type to its corresponding list of implementations
   - Use ComponentType.EMBEDDER, ComponentType.RETRIEVER, and ComponentType.GENERATOR as keys
   - Assign the constructor parameters (embedders, retrievers, generators) as values

3. Explore the **high-availability system architecture** in `system.py`:
   - Review the `__init__` method (Task 3c) to understand how components and circuit breakers are initialized
   - Note how the fallback strategy is created with all available implementations of each component

4. Implement the **final fallback mechanism** in the `get_embedding` method (Task 3d):
   - Complete the empty fallback return statement in try_fallback_embedder
   - Create a zero vector with the same dimension as the primary embedder
   - Use embedders[0].dimension to determine the correct size
   - This provides graceful degradation when all embedding services fail

5. Understand the **document retrieval fallback chain** (Task 3e):
   - Examine how the system tries each retriever in sequence
   - Note how it gracefully degrades to returning an empty list when all retrievers fail

6. Explore the **response generation fallback chain** (Task 3f):
   - Review how the system tries each generator in sequence
   - Note how it provides a helpful error message when all generators fail

7. Complete the **RAG pipeline** in the query method (Task 3g):
   - Implement Step 1: Call self.get_embedding with the user_query
   - Implement Step 2: Call self.get_relevant_documents with the embedding and top_k=3
   - Implement Step 3: Call self.generate_response with the query and retrieved documents
   - Return the generated response to the user

8. Examine the **system health monitoring** functionality (Task 3h):
   - Understand how the get_system_health method provides metrics for all components
   - Note how it tracks circuit state, failure rate, and average response time

9. Test the complete fallback strategy by executing the application and observing:
   - How primary services fail and trigger fallbacks
   - The degradation in quality as fallbacks are used
   - The system's ability to continue functioning despite multiple failures
